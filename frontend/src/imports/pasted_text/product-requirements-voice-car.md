## Smart Post-Discharge Voice Care Assistant
### *Smart VoiceCare — Indic Voice AI Patient Engagement*

---

> **"One call. One conversation. A life saved."**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

India discharges tens of millions of inpatients every year — and the moment a patient steps out of the hospital gate, structured medical support largely vanishes. The **Smart Post-Discharge Voice Care Assistant** is an AI-powered, multilingual voice system that automatically calls discharged patients, holds a natural conversation in their preferred language, detects warning symptoms, scores risk in real time, and instantly alerts doctors when action is needed.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Product Name** | Smart VoiceCare |
| **Theme** | Indic Voice AI Patient Engagement |
| **Primary Market** | India (Tier 1–3 cities + rural) |
| **Target Users** | Discharged patients, doctors, hospital admins |
| **Core Channel** | Outbound voice call (works on any basic phone) |

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 The Silent Crisis After Discharge

Every year, crores of patients are discharged from Indian hospitals — from AIIMS Delhi to small private clinics in rural Bihar. The moment they leave, structured medical support vanishes. They receive a discharge summary (often in English they cannot read), a list of medicines, and a follow-up date weeks away.

**Real Impact:**
- **15–25%** of cardiac and surgical patients experience avoidable post-discharge complications
- Preventable readmissions cost patients **₹15,000–₹1,00,000+** per event
- India has **1 doctor per 1,445 people** vs WHO-recommended 1 per 1,000
- Over **300 million** hospital outpatient visits annually

### 2.2 Why Current Systems Fail

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| No structured follow-up mechanism | Patients deteriorate undetected |
| Discharge summaries in English | Critical instructions lost for non-English speakers |
| Doctor overload | Doctors cannot monitor every discharged patient |
| Health apps require smartphones | Rural and elderly patients excluded |
| Patients don't recognise dangerous symptoms | Delayed action, preventable deaths |

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

**Replace post-discharge silence with a proactive, intelligent, voice-based companion that speaks the patient's language — literally.**

- ✅ No app required
- ✅ No internet required
- ✅ No literacy required
- ✅ Works on any basic phone or landline

## 5. Conversation State Machine

The AI conversation follows a structured state machine ensuring clinical completeness while feeling natural:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `GREETING` | Confirms patient identity and language preference |
| `GENERAL_WELLBEING` | Open question: "How are you feeling overall today?" |
| `CONDITION_SPECIFIC_CHECK` | Targeted questions by diagnosis (cardiac, diabetic, surgical, orthopaedic) |
| `MEDICATION_CHECK` | Confirms medication adherence |
| `DIET_MOBILITY` | Dietary compliance and mobility level |
| `ESCALATION` *(conditional)* | Triggered if High/Critical symptom detected at any stage |
| `CLOSING` | Reassurance, next call reminder, emergency contact number |

> **Design Principle:** The state machine enforces clinical completeness; the LLM handles conversational naturalness. The LLM can ask follow-ups, revisit topics, or skip ahead based on patient responses.

## 10. Deployment Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Pilot (Months 1–3)
- One hospital, 100–200 discharged patients per month
- Hindi + English only
- Measure: readmission reduction, alert accuracy, patient satisfaction

### Phase 2 — City-Level Rollout (Months 4–9)
- Integrate with Hospital Management Systems (HMS)
- Expand to Hindi + 3 regional languages
- Multi-hospital dashboard

### Phase 3 — National Scale (Months 10+)
- Integrate with Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) patient records
- Deploy via Bhashini across government hospitals
- All 22 Indian scheduled languages

> **Language Expansion:** New language support requires only plugging in a new Bhashini language model — zero architectural changes.

---

## 11. Impact Metrics & Success Criteria

### For Patients
- Early detection of post-discharge complications
- Recovery guidance in their own language
- Reduced preventable emergency readmissions

### For Doctors
- Zero extra workload for routine follow-ups
- Dashboard ranked by risk level
- Documented transcripts for patient progress review

### For Hospitals
- **20–40% potential reduction** in preventable 30-day readmissions
- Cost savings: one prevented readmission > cost of hundreds of AI follow-up calls
- Improved NABH accreditation scores

### Economics
| Item | Cost / Value |
|------|-------------|
| AI follow-up call cost | ₹5–10 per call |
| Prevented readmission saving | ₹15,000–₹1,00,000 |
| ROI | Unambiguously positive at any scale |
