**Smart VoiceCare** is an AI-powered, multilingual post-discharge voice assistant. It leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Twilio telephony to automatically contact discharged patients on basic phone calls, hold a natural conversation in their preferred local language (e.g., Hindi), detect critical symptoms in real time, score risks, and instantly alert doctors when serious medical action is required.

## 🚀 The Core Problem

Every year across India, millions of hospital patients are discharged with a medical summary they possibly cannot read, losing access to structured follow-up care. Preventable readmissions and unseen deteriorations cost thousands of lives and massive sums in late-stage interventions.

Current systems fail because:
- Follow-ups require smartphone apps (excluding rural/elderly patients).
- Manual call centres are not scalable for massive patient loads.
- Key medical instructions are provided in English, causing a language barrier.

## 💡 The Solution

We replace post-discharge silence with a proactive **AI voice companion that speaks the patient's language**.

- 📞 **Works on Any Phone:** No apps, no internet, no smartphones required. Only a standard telecom voice call via Twilio.
- 🗣️ **Multilingual & Colloquial:** Powered by Gemini and Ultravox AI to fluidly understand regional dialects and terminology (e.g., understanding "thoda dard hai" as mild pain and reacting accordingly).
- 🚨 **Real-Time Triaging:** Automatically classifies patients into **Low**, **Medium**, **High**, or **Critical** risk categories. Alerts doctors via dashboards and SMS triggers immediately if dangerous symptoms are flagged.
- 📊 **Doctor Dashboard:** A centralized, live-updating React front-end application tailored for hospital administrators to view patient wellbeing across the clinical landscape.

## ⚡ Getting Started (Local Development)

This is a comprehensive monorepo consisting of discrete `frontend` and `backend` application modules. Run them concurrently for local development.

### 1. Backend API Server (Port: 8000)
Navigate to the `backend/` directory, install packages, and initialize the Express daemon:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Frontend React Dashboard (Port: 5173)
Open another terminal, navigate to the `frontend/` directory, install module components, and initialize Vite:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

*(Refer to the [Setup Documentation](./docs/setup.md) for full `.env` variable initialization, primarily configuring your Supabase db keys and your Twilio SID!)*
