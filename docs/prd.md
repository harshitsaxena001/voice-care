## Smart Post-Discharge Voice Care Assistant
### *Smart VoiceCare — Indic Voice AI Patient Engagement*

---

> **"One call. One conversation. A life saved."**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

India discharges tens of millions of inpatients every year — and the moment a patient steps out of the hospital gate, structured medical support largely vanishes. The **Smart Post-Discharge Voice Care Assistant** is an AI-powered, multilingual voice system that automatically calls discharged patients, holds a natural conversation in their preferred language, detects warning symptoms, scores risk in real time, and instantly alerts doctors when action is needed.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Product Name** | Smart VoiceCare |
| **Theme** | Indic Voice AI Patient Engagement |
| **Primary Market** | India (Tier 1–3 cities + rural) |
| **Target Users** | Discharged patients, doctors, hospital admins |
| **Core Channel** | Outbound voice call (works on any basic phone) |

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 The Silent Crisis After Discharge

Every year, crores of patients are discharged from Indian hospitals — from AIIMS Delhi to small private clinics in rural Bihar. The moment they leave, structured medical support vanishes. They receive a discharge summary (often in English they cannot read), a list of medicines, and a follow-up date weeks away.

**Real Impact:**
- **15–25%** of cardiac and surgical patients experience avoidable post-discharge complications
- Preventable readmissions cost patients **₹15,000–₹1,00,000+** per event
- India has **1 doctor per 1,445 people** vs WHO-recommended 1 per 1,000
- Over **300 million** hospital outpatient visits annually

### 2.2 Why Current Systems Fail

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| No structured follow-up mechanism | Patients deteriorate undetected |
| Discharge summaries in English | Critical instructions lost for non-English speakers |
| Doctor overload | Doctors cannot monitor every discharged patient |
| Health apps require smartphones | Rural and elderly patients excluded |
| Patients don't recognise dangerous symptoms | Delayed action, preventable deaths |

## 3. Proposed Solution

**Replace post-discharge silence with a proactive, intelligent, voice-based companion that speaks the patient's language — literally.**

The solution leverages **Ultravox**, a cutting-edge multimodal AI voice platform, to handle end-to-end voice interaction (speech recognition, LLM conversation, and text-to-speech) integrated seamlessly with **Node.js** backend and **Twilio** telephony. This ensures:

- ✅ No app required
- ✅ No internet required
- ✅ No literacy required
- ✅ Works on any basic phone or landline
- ✅ Real-time voice conversation powered by advanced AI (Gemini)
- ✅ Instant risk detection and escalation

## 5. Conversation State Machine

The AI conversation follows a structured state machine ensuring clinical completeness while feeling natural:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `GREETING` | Confirms patient identity and language preference |
| `GENERAL_WELLBEING` | Open question: "How are you feeling overall today?" |
| `CONDITION_SPECIFIC_CHECK` | Targeted questions by diagnosis (cardiac, diabetic, surgical, orthopaedic) |
| `MEDICATION_CHECK` | Confirms medication adherence |
| `DIET_MOBILITY` | Dietary compliance and mobility level |
| `ESCALATION` *(conditional)* | Triggered if High/Critical symptom detected at any stage |
| `CLOSING` | Reassurance, next call reminder, emergency contact number |

> **Design Principle:** Gemini LLM via Ultravox enforces clinical completeness while maintaining conversational naturalness. The system can ask follow-ups, revisit topics, or skip ahead based on patient responses, all within a single voice interaction.

## 7. Key Differentiators / Hackathon Highlights

### 7.1 Structured Transcripts in the Doctor's Dashboard
Voice conversations are messy. Post-call, the raw text transcript is passed through an LLM (like GPT/Claude) with a strict prompt to output **Structured JSON**. Specific fields like `Chief_Complaint`, `Symptom_Duration`, `Pain_Scale_1_to_10`, and `Requested_Time` are extracted. The doctor's dashboard simply reads this JSON and displays it as clean badges and bullet points, keeping the raw text hidden under a 'View Full Transcript' dropdown.

### 7.2 Admin Inputs & Dynamic Prompts (Name, Phone, Problem, Flow)
We use **Dynamic Prompt Engineering** on our Node.js backend. When the twilio webhook triggers, our system fetches the patient's data (Name, Phone, Problem, Flow) from the PostgreSQL database (Supabase). We dynamically inject these variables into the System Prompt before passing it to the AI. Example: *"You are calling [Patient Name] who recently had [Knee Surgery]."* This makes the AI highly personalized without writing new code for every patient.

### 7.3 Handling Different Workflows (Screening, OPD->IPD, Follow-ups, Vaccination)
Instead of one massive, confused AI bot, we designed **Specialized Agent Prompts** based on the patient's journey stage.
1. **Screening to OPD:** The AI acts as a triage nurse (Symptom collection -> Suggests OPD visit).
2. **OPD to IPD:** Explains admission details, insurance paperwork reminders, and fasting rules before surgery.
3. **Post-Discharge:** Tracks recovery and checks if the patient is taking meds on time.
4. **Newborn Vaccination:** A scheduled chronological agent that automatically calls parents at 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 14 weeks for missed vaccines. 
The database strictly assigns the `flow_type` to the patient row, and the backend routes the call logic accordingly.

### 7.4 Appointment Scheduling with Human-in-the-Loop (Doctor Confirmation)
To ensure 100% safety, we implemented a **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** system. The Voice Agent is never allowed to say *"Your appointment is 100% confirmed."* Instead, the AI negotiates a preferred time slot with the patient and says, *"I have requested a slot for Tuesday at 4 PM. You will get a final confirmation shortly."*
In our Supabase database, this appointment is saved with the status `PENDING`. It shows up on the Doctor's (or Receptionist's) dashboard. Once the doctor checks their schedule and clicks **'Approve'**, the database status changes to `CONFIRMED`, and our system can automatically trigger a Twilio SMS notifying the patient. This completely eliminates double-booking issues.
